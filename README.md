# SpaceShooter
Space shooting game

In order to make the game work you first need to link the project to your SFML location. In Visual Studio, Project -> SpaceShooter Properties -> Linker -> General -> Additional Libary Directories and set the path to your SFML /lib folder. 
Same goes for  Project -> SpaceShooter Properties -> C/C++ -> General -> Additional Libary Directories but this time the SFML /include folder. And compile the code in x86 not x64
